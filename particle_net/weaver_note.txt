Hey Connor. I absolutely agree that Weaver's documentation is pretty thin. I have a fork of the repository where I store my code (https://github.com/akobert/weaver-core). Anything relevant to your question can be found in the training/ directory. The current version of the yaml file I am working with is CMSAK8_PN_v8.yaml.
Many of the categories that are in there I had to figure out via trial and error. The important ones are:
---
selection: literally selection on events to be used for training

test_time_selection: selection used when running "prediction"

new_variables: can define new variables not included in input files

inputs: define features used for training, should base this on the model you use. For example, this is based on the inputs to my model in PN_network_v8.py and my testing using the standard ParticleNet onnx file and preprocess.json file (the later of which is also in the repository)

labels: use to define training categories, I am doing classification so I do type:simple and list the categories for training

observers: list other variables you want to track, but not use as training input. I use the various fatJet variables so I can see performance vs. those variables later. I also include the standard ParticleNet output scores for later comparison

weights: How much the various events are weighted for training. I flatten in bins of pt and mass, and weight based on this. I also do class reweighting, this is to ensure that the classification prioritizes classification of different diquark scores, instead of between different QCD types.

For things like reweighting and selection, you can do different things from myself depending on what you are training for, the rest should be more or less the same
If you want to see the code I use to generate my ROC curves, that is in the ROC/ directory in the same repository (edited)
